      <h2>Meet Feanyui Beauty</h2>
      <p><strong>Hi there!</strong> Welcome to Feanyui Beauty. <em>Pronounced Fen-Way</em></p>
      <p>Here, we celebrate you.</p>
      <p>Growing up in a family of women, I was the go-to for everyone’s crown—my sisters, my friends, and even my own. Over time, what started as care and connection evolved into something greater. Braiding became my art, my expression, and my way of celebrating the beauty and strength in every individual.</p>
      <p>Feanyui Beauty is more than a braiding service; it’s a space rooted in care and intention. Here, your time matters, your hair health matters, and you matter. Whether you're embracing a fresh start or simply amplifying the beauty already within you, I’m here to make sure you leave feeling confident and radiant.</p>
